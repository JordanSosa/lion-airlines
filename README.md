## How to contribute with Git
1. Clone the git repository to create a local repo.
2. CD into that local repo folder and use git branch to create your own branch.
3. Work on your feature/addition and then add/commit as usual.
4. Do not merge the branch with your local main.
5. Instead you should do git push --set-upstream origin <branch> to push your entire branch to the remote repository, then you can do a pull request as normal.
